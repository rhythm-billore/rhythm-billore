<h2 align="center">📘 About Me</h2>

📊 I enjoy turning messy data into clear, meaningful stories. Numbers feel like quiet puzzles to me , pieces that reveal meaning when placed thoughtfully. Whether I'm shaping a modern data stack, training a model, or building a Streamlit app, I enjoy the mix of logic, design, and curiosity that data work demands.

✨ I believe good analytics isn’t just about accuracy. It’s about stories, clarity, and decisions that lead to better understanding. That’s why I gravitate toward projects where engineering meets insight - pipelines that feel smooth, dashboards that feel intuitive, and models that feel honest.

🧠 I explore data engineering, analytics, ML, and cloud tools with a maker’s mindset: build, refine, simplify, repeat. Tools change - the excitement of learning doesn't.

💛 **Fun fact:** True to my name **Rhythm** I aim to remain well-tuned, calm, and composed in everything I do.

☕ Outside the tech bubble, you'll find me reading, exploring vegetarian cooking, or working through ideas away from the screen.
